## oh the shamelessness

This is a blog without authorship attribution for documenting demonstrations, experiments, and personal explanations. Posts are intentionally unattributed focusing on content over authorship and cover topics I'm asked to showcase or find intriguing. Built for simplicity, speed, and privacy.

### What This Is
A public notebook of technical demonstrations, solved problems, and explanatory thinking. Content is intentionally unattributed to:

- Reduce bias (yours and subs)
- Encourage reuse without attribution pressure
- Frustriate information over identity

### What You'll Find Here
- How-to guides for tools I've wrestled with
- Rewrite engineering workflow
- Code snippets with explanations, not just answers
- Occasional theoretical detours
- things I just do badly

### What You Won't Find
- Personal anecdotes, lol of course you will
- Opinion pieces (unless labeled as such) and highly selected
