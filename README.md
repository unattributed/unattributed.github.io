## ⚙️ About This Site

This blog is built using the [unattributed-theme](https://github.com/unattributed/unattributed-theme),  
a minimalist Jekyll theme designed for privacy, clarity, and control.

There is:

- No JavaScript tracking
- No external dependencies
- No telemetry

Just plain text, intentional publishing, and tools that serve the writer — not the platform.
