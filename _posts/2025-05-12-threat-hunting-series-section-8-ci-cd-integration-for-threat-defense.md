# Secure DevOps: Integrating Threat Hunting into CI/CD Pipelines

Incorporating threat hunting into your CI/CD pipelines shifts security left ‚Äî embedding detection logic, artifact scanning, and behavioral validation into every deployment. This approach enhances both cybersecurity and system reliability engineering (SRE) by ensuring each release is security-vetted, observable, and verifiable.

## Example: Trigger Lambda Rule in CI Test Stage

<div style="position:relative;">
  <button onclick="copyCode('code12')" style="position:absolute;top:0;right:0;">Copy</button>
  <button onclick="downloadCode('code12', 'lambda_trigger_test.py')" style="position:absolute;top:0;right:60px;">Download</button>
</div>
<pre id="code12" style="background:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;padding:1em;"><code>
import boto3

def trigger_lambda_test():
    client = boto3.client('lambda')
    response = client.invoke(
        FunctionName='DetectPublicS3Bucket',
        Payload=b'{"test": "PutBucketPolicyPublic"}'
    )
    print(response['StatusCode'])
</code></pre>

## Elastic CI/CD Integration

You can push rule coverage reports, detections, and telemetry from your CI/CD pipelines into Elastic:

- Track which builds trigger which detection rules
- Store and search historical build security events
- Visualize security health per branch, developer, or tag

---

## DevSecOps Implementation Tips

1. **Version control YARA rules and Elastic detection DSL.**
2. **Automate rule regression testing** in CI pipelines.
3. **Fail the build** if critical threats are detected.
4. **Alert SREs on suspicious deploy-time behaviors.**
5. **Use ML models to compare post-deploy metrics** to prior norms.

## Sample GitHub CI/CD Workflow (Simplified)

<div style="position:relative;">
  <button onclick="copyCode('code13')" style="position:absolute;top:0;right:0;">Copy</button>
  <button onclick="downloadCode('code13', 'github_ci_security.yml')" style="position:absolute;top:0;right:60px;">Download</button>
</div>
<pre id="code13" style="background:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;padding:1em;"><code>
name: CI Security Checks
on: [push]
jobs:
  threat-hunt:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Run YARA Scans
      run: yara -r rules.yar ./build || exit 1
    - name: Invoke Elastic webhook on success
      run: |
        curl -X POST \
        https://elastic.example.com/detections/ci-update \
        -d '{"status": "secure"}'
</code></pre>

## Benefits for Cybersecurity & SRE Teams

- **Shift-left security** enforces controls earlier.
- **Observable infrastructure** maps risks to operational insights.
- **Fail fast, secure fast:** Secure failures detected before they reach production.

By embedding cloud threat hunting capabilities directly into your CI/CD workflows, you automate vigilance, ensure accountability, and empower engineers to ship secure-by-default systems.
